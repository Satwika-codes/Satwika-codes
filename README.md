## Hi there 👋

# DSA Solutions

This repository contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved mainly in C++ and Python.

## Structure

- Solutions are organized by topic folders (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees).  
- Each solution file is named clearly with the problem name or number.  

## Goal

Build a strong foundation in DSA by consistent daily problem solving.
